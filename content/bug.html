    </font>
    </h1>
    <p>Bugis is the most widely used language of Indonesia's South Sulawesi Province. Its speakers, also called the
      Bugis, have historically been among the most enterprising peoples of Southeast Asia. The dynasties founded by
      Bugis adventurers ranged over thousands of miles, from Sumatra to the Lesser Sunda Islands; even today, Bugis
      Street, more than a thousand miles west of the Bugis homeland, remains a favorite haunt of many Singaporeans.</p>
    <p>The Bugis adopted writing through disputed channels in the fifteenth century, and they have been a literate
      people ever since. Their traditional script, the <i>lontaraq</i>, is an abugida, a writing system that writes
      only consonants as full letters and vowels as diacritics (accent marks). Most of the poetry discussed here is
      written in this script.</p>
    <p>The Bugis converted to Islam in the early seventeenth century, although a very small animist minority still
      remains. However, even as Muslims, most Bugis continue to hold the pre-Islamic epic poem <i>I La Galigo</i>, one
      of the longest works of poetry ever created, in high regard. Besides the <i>I La Galigo</i>, the Bugis literary
      tradition includes many other forms of poetry.</p>

    <p>Bugis meter is usually strictly <a href="#meter.html#EnglishHaiku">syllable-counting</a>. There are three types:
      a five-syllable meter, very rare outside the sacred epic <i>I La Galigo</i>; an eight-syllable meter; and <i>élong</i>,
      a three-stanza poem with an 8-7-6 meter.</p>
    <p>However, there is one exception to syllable-counting, called <i>oxytonal shortening</i>. A stressed syllable in
      fourth position may function as two syllables, meaning that four- or seven-syllable lines are permitted.</p>
    <p>This is a good example of <i>phonological archaism</i> in poetry. On some level, poets still remember that most
      stressed syllables in Bugis originally developed from contractions of two syllables. For example, the stressed
      final syllable <i>-é</i> in modern Bugis developed from a historic <i>-ia</i>, and a final stressed <i>-óng</i>
      was originally <i>-oang</i>. Bugis poets have kept to an ancient five-syllable meter, one possibly even predating
      the fifteenth-century introduction of writing (which writes <i>-é</i> or <i>-óng</i> according to modern
      one-syllable pronunciation), even when it means accepting exceptions today.</p>
    <p>The <i>I La Galigo</i> is written in a five-syllable meter. The average word in the <i>I La Galigo</i> is 2.7
      syllables long, which means that one sentence of even middling length must be in multiple five-syllable lines.
      The <i>I La Galigo</i> developed strict rules as to where sentences can be cut:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lines cannot cut words in half. An exception allows a noun with two roots to be separated according to its
        roots, but even this is rare; generally speaking, words are uncuttable. This includes all proper nouns, even
        place names with obvious meaning.</li>
      <li>In Bugis, independent or content words tend to be clustered together and surrounded by particles on either
        side. For example, the <i>I La Galigo</i> lines translated as "He had also not yet finished pronouncing his
        good words" in Bugis is "tĕng lĕppĕq ada madeceng to pa", literally glossing to "not he-had-finished words good
        also yet". The content words ("he-had-finished words good") are called the <i>nucleus</i>, the rest the <i>periphery</i>,
        and the whole thing a <i>complex</i>. There are rules to when a complex may belong to different lines:
  </p>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>The nucleus may be cut into two lines.</li>
    <li>The left-hand periphery (the periphery that comes before the nucleus) may never be spread out in two different
      lines, nor be in a line different from the nucleus.</li>
    <li>If there is a stressed syllable in the right-hand periphery (RHP) that comes after the nucleus, the RHP may be
      cut into different lines, but the stressed syllable itself and at least one other syllable must fall into the
      second line.</p>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>This means that in the case of "tĕng lĕppĕq ada madeceng to pa", cutting the sentence into different lines at
    "tĕng | lĕppĕq ada madeceng to pa" isn't permitted (can't separate the left-hand periphery from the nucleus), nor
    is "tĕng lĕppĕq ada madeceng to | pa" (<i>pa</i> is not stressed, and even if it were, at least two syllables from
    the RHP needs to be carried over to the next line).</p>
  <p>But theoretically, "tĕng lĕppĕq | ada madeceng to pa", "tĕng lĕppĕq ada | madeceng to pa", and "tĕng lĕppĕq ada
    madeceng | to pa" (<i>to</i> is stressed) would all be permitted.
    <p>The following excerpt from the <i>I La Galigo</i> portrays the hero Sawérigading as having fallen in love with
      his long-lost twin sister. His sister is unenthusiastic and his parents aghast, with his mother scolding him and
      Sawérigading replying in the lines quoted below. <i>I La Galigo</i> lines are separated with bars and stressed
      syllables provoking oxytonal shortening are in red. Bugis has no diphthongs, and something like "ei" is two
      syllables (e-i).</p>

    <p>The Bugis genre of <i>toloq</i> is metrically marked by eight-syllable lines, and also prefers parallelistic
      structures. Both features are visible in the quoted excerpt of the <i>Toloqna Musuq Boné</i>, about the Bugis
      queen of Boné and the Dutch (traditionally called <i>kompania</i> in Bugis after the Dutch East India Company)
      both preparing bullets for war. With the exception of a single one-word, four-syllable line, everything is in
      eight syllables, and parallelism is pervasive:</p>

    <p>Finally, the genre of <i>élong</i> involves sung stanzas of three lines with a decreasing number of syllables
      per line. The classical <i>élong</i> meter is, as mentioned, 8-7-6. I have revised the translations somewhat to

        <font face="times new roman"><b>The <i>I La Galigo</i></b></font>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>The <i>I La Galigo</i> (ILG) is one of both the greatest and the least-known masterpieces of world literature.</p>
    <p>Written in an episodic format using a steady five-syllable meter, the ILG extols the exploits of the first
      generations of gods and humans on earth, as recalled by the hero La Galigo. Although there is no comprehensive
      version of the work, if all the varying episodes that make up the epic were somehow put together, the poem would
      probably be the longest in world history, clocking at nearly five times the length of the entire Bible (and
      several tens of thousands of lines longer than the Sanskrit <i>Mahabharata</i>, usually called the world's
      longest epic poem). However, and despite the fact that the Bugis themselves perceive ILG as a single work, the
      poem is dispersed into thousands of manuscripts, mostly in private possession, ranging from a few lines at most
      to at least a hundred pages but never covering more than a few episodes of the vast epic. Even the longest single
      edition, a 2,851-page, twelve-volume version compiled in the late ninteenth century, comprises no more than a
      small fraction of the diversity of the ILG.</p>
    <p>However, the ILG manuscripts remain astonishingly consistent, and it is difficult to argue that the manuscripts
      do not together make up a single poetic work. There is little variation in meter—the five-syllable-counting is
      everywhere abided—and Koolhof 1999 remarks that even the countless manuscripts "are firmly interconnected. The
      homogeneity of the extant manuscripts is remarkable, and the various episodes... fit like the pieces of a jigsaw
      puzzle. The family relationship of the protagonists in their hundreds is consistent throughout, and for most
      episodes the chronology is fairly easy to determine."</p>
    <p>The ILG is in many ways a text intentionally made to sound ancient. It is written in an archaic register of
      Bugis that includes many expressions now obsolete or perhaps never used in the spoken language and also eschews
      loanwords from Malay, Arabic, and European languages that are now inseparable from the language, such as <i>sorodadu</i>
      for "soldier" (Dutch <i>soldaat</i>) or <i>bandéra</i> for "flag" (Portuguese <i>bandeira</i>).</p>
    <p>Below, we have a very simplified version of the lineage of gods and heroes in the ILG.</p>

    <p id="Toloq">
      <font size="5">
        <font face="times new roman"><b>The <i>Toloq</i></b></font>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p><i>Toloq</i> refers to eight-syllable-line narrative poems that cover wildly varying topics: epic history, love
      stories, erotica, satire. The majority, however, are heroic poems discussing historical events.
      <p>Heroic <i>toloq</i> have a number of narrative conventions that must be adhered to:</p>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Certain poetic words and metaphors (the so-called "poetic language") must be used. One very common refrain
          in the genre is <i>Makkedi la ménrurana</i> "So spoke the sovereign." Others include <i>Ala maressaq otaé /
            Ala kédéq pabbojaé</i> "Faster than betel [a type of gum] can be chewed / In the twinkling of an eye".</li>
        <li>Specific dates should not be given, only relative ones such as "three days later". Even here, there is a
          preference to have events occur at intervals of three, seven, or forty days, months, or years, even when this
          goes against the historical facts.</li>
        <li>Personal names may be avoided in favor of oblique references such as <i>opu lebbuq biritta</i> "lord with
          the famous name" for the protagonist or <i>Jiniralana Bettawé</i> "Batavia general" for the Dutch
          Governor-General. Batavia was the Dutch colonial capital.</li>
        <li>There must be <i>suro</i> scenes, in which a ruler's words to a messenger are provided, then later repeated
          verbatim in the text, this time spoken by the messenger.</li>
        <li>There must be a <i>mangngaruq</i> scene, in which the commanders and heroes swear elaborate oaths of
          allegiance before the king as they prepare to go to war.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, as is always the case in poetry, these rules are never followed to the letter. The following <i>toloq</i>,
        discussing the turbulent events of the 1810s when Napoleonic shenannigans caused the British to briefly replace
        the Dutch as the dominant European power in Indonesia, explicitly gives the date in the Christian calendar (the
        Bugis traditionally used the Christian calendar despite being Muslim):</p>

        </font>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>élong</i> is by far the most divergent form of Bugis poetry. Always sung (the word literally translates
        to "song") and often accompanied by violin and flute, and usually but not always a triplet of eight, seven, and
        finally six syllables per line, the Bugis classify the genre into at least the following categories:</p>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><i>Élong anaq-anaq</i>: Nursery rhymes</li>
        <li><i>Élong éjaq-éjaq</i>: Songs sung by young lovers</li>
        <li><i>Élong maddakkala</i>: Plowing songs</li>
        <li><i>Élong maliung bettuanna</i>: Riddle songs, discussed below</li>
        <li><i>Élong mappadicawa</i>: Nonsense joke songs</li>
        <li><i>Élong mapparéré</i>: Also songs exchanged between bride and groom during weddings, but more sharply so</li>
        <li><i>Élong massagala</i>: Songs sung during smallpox epidemics</li>
        <li><i>Élong osong</i>: War songs</li>
        <li><i>Élong padondoq-anaq</i>: Lullabies</li>
        <li><i>Élong pangngajaq</i>: Songs of proverbial wisdom</li>
        <li><i>Élong sisseng-ngisseng</i>: Songs whose lines are courteously exchanged between bride and groom during
          weddings</li>
        <li><i>Élong tomaloloq</i>: Songs about love</li>
        <li><i>Élong topanrita</i>: Songs about Islam sung by Muslim clerics</li>
        <li><i>Élong totoq</i>: Songs about orphans, as seen above</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most <i>élong</i> genres do not appear very well-studied in non-Indonesian scholarship.</p>

        </font>
      </p>
      <p>Among the most interesting sub-genres of <i>élong</i> is <i>élong maliung bettuanna</i>, literally "deep
        meaning songs". "Deep" here refers not to any philosophical depth (in which case <i>élong pangngajaq</i> would
        be "deepest") but to the fact that the song has a hidden meaning.</p>
      <p><i>Élong maliung bettuanna</i> demands close familiarity with Bugis writing, culture, and geography to be
        properly understood, and always requires two levels of interpretation.</p>

              </div>
          </i></font>
      </font>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>First level of interpretation: the kennings.</b> There are two kennings (circumlocutional expressions)
        here: "mountain crocodile" and "river silt". A learned Bugis reader or listener would understand that a
        "mountain crocodile" is a tiger, while "river silt" is sand. But the song is still meaningless: "Which do you
        prefer, a tiger or sand?"</p>
      <p><b>Second level of interpretation: the script.</b> In Bugis, "tiger" is <i>macang</i> and "sand" is <i>kessiq</i>.</p>
      <p>The Bugis script has a number of peculiarities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double consonants are not written. <i>Ppa</i> and <i>pa</i> are written identically.</li>
        <li>Final -ng and -q are not written. <i>Ppang</i> and <i>paq</i> are written the same as <i>ppa</i> and <i>pa</i>.</li>
        <li>An initial m- followed by a consonant is not written. <i>Mpaq</i> is written the same as <i>ppang</i>, <i>paq</i>,
          <i>ppa</i>, and <i>pa</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The word <i>macang</i> "tiger" is written like this:</p>
      <center>
        <font size="30">ᨆᨌ</font>
      </center>
      <p>But because of the principles we've just listed (double consonants and final -ng ignored), these two letters
        could also be pronounced <i>macca</i>. This word happens to mean "clever".</p>
      <p>Similarly, the word <i>kessiq</i> "sand" is written:</p>
      <center>
        <font size="30">ᨀᨙᨔᨗ</font>
      </center>
      <p>This can be read as <i>kessing</i> "beautiful", because final -q and final -ng are both ignored. So the poem
        actually means:</p>
      <center>
        <p>Which do you prefer, a smart person [<i>macca</i>] or a beautiful one [<i>kessing</i>]?</p>
      </center>
      <p>(It's not a fixed rule that the written form should make no distinction between the meaning of the kenning and
        the ultimate meaning, so long as there's a close phonological similarity.)</p>
      <p>Or if you wanted to ask out your crush in a roundabout way, you could write him or her the following poem:</p>
      <font face="times new roman">
        <font size="4.5"><i>
            <blockquote>
              <div class="row">

              </div>
          </i></font>
      </font>

      <p>And he or she might respond:</p>

              </div>
          </i></font>
      </font>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i>What the hell does this mean?</i></p>
      <p><b>First level of interpretation.</b> Each line is a kenning. The first use of curved metal that would come to
        a premodern Bugis person's mind is as a fishhook, <i>méng</i> in Bugis. The Mandar are an Indonesian ethnic
        group famous for their bananas, <i>loka</i> in Bugis. The opposite of a fish's head is its tail, <i>ikkoq</i>
        in Bugis. The Bugis don't seem to have liked sour things very much, and the closest thing they have to a "sour
        drink" is tea, <i>téng</i>. Finally, the opposite of "above" is obviously "down", <i>awa</i>.</p>
      <p>Now that the kennings have been figured out, we have the following:</p>
      <font face="times new roman">
        <font size="4.5"><i>

        </font></i>
      </font>
      <p>Wow, this makes even less sense than before.</p>
      <p><b>Second level of interpretation.</b> Bugis writing traditionally does not space words. So if we write those
        two lines above, we have:</p>
      <center>
        <font size="30">ᨆᨙ &ensp; ᨒᨚ &ensp; ᨀ &ensp; ᨕᨗ &ensp; ᨀᨚ</font>
      </center>
      <br>
      <center>
        <font size="30">ᨈᨙ &ensp; ᨕ &ensp; ᨓ &ensp; ᨕᨗ &ensp; ᨀᨚ</font>
      </center>
      <p>The first line could be read <i>méng loka ikkoq</i> "fishhook banana tail", but because there aren't spaces to
        tell you where to separate the words, it could also be read as <i>méloq kaq iko</i>, which means "I love you".
        Remember, double consonants, -q, and -ng don't count.</p>
      <p>The second line, similarly, might be read <i>téng awa ikkoq</i> "tea down tail", but also <i>téa waq iko</i>,
        "I don't want you".</p>
      <p>So that's how to confess your love or reject someone's confession in Bugis poetry. Now you know.</p>
