  <blockquote>
    <p class="text-quoted">Chen Gang asked Boyu [the son of Confucius], "Has the Master imparted to you some different
      knowledge?”</p>

    <p class="text-quoted">Boyu replied, "Once he was standing alone as I hurried across the courtyard, and he said to
      me,
      ‘Have you studied the <em>Poetry</em>?’</p>

    <p class="text-quoted">I replied, ‘Not yet,’ and he said, ‘If you don’t study the <em>Poetry</em>, you will have
      nothing
      to speak.'"</p>

    <p style="text-align:right"><em>

    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="text-main">The very word has an allure about it. "Poetry", a simple Google search reveals, has the
    implicit meaning of "a
    quality of beauty and intensity of emotion"; it might also mean "something regarded as comparable to poetry in
    its beauty". Merriam-Webster concurs; poetry is something remarkable in its "beauty of expression". Nor are
    Anglophones alone. More than a thousand years ago, the Arab writer Ibn 'Abbād (trained in both prose and verse)
    wrote:</p>

  <p class="text-quoted">"Prose is scattered hither and thither like flying stones, but poetry will
    last long as graven stone."</p>

  <p class="text-main">And Ibn 'Abbād seems to have been right, at least since much more of his verse remains than his
    prose.</p>

  <p class="text-main">For all this, it's remarkable how vague the dictionary definitions of poetry are. Google is
    quick to tell us
    that "poetry" is "literary work in which special intensity is given to the expression of feelings and ideas by
    the use of distinctive style and rhythm". But what distinctive style and rhythm are these? Merriam-Webster turns
    out to be no better. "Arranged to create a specific emotional response through meaning, sound, and rhythm"—what
    meaning, what sound, what rhythm? Why is free verse, which is explicitly about not having fixed rhythm, poetry,
    while <i>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall</i> is just a "nursery rhyme"?</p>

  <p class="text-main">We need a more technical definition. The <i>World Atlas of Poetic Traditions</i> uses the one
    proposed by
    linguist Nigel Fabb in his 2015 monograph <i>What is Poetry?: Language and Memory in the Poems of the World</i>.
    It goes like this:</p>

  <p class="text-quoted">"A poem is a text made of language, divided into sections that are not
    determined by syntactic or prosodic structure."</p>

  <p class="text-main" style="text-align:center">Let's see what this means exactly:</p>

  <br />

  <h2 class="text-appetizer">Poetry isn't (necessarily) syntactically organized</h2>

  <p class="text-main">Sections of poetry are not determined by the syntactic (grammatical) divisions of the text.
    They might coincide,
    but a line of poetry is not a coherent syntactic unit.</p>

  <p class="text-main">Let's look at a famous English poem.</p>

    <font face="times new roman">"Invictus", William Ernest Henley, 1875</font>
  </p>

  <p>This poem is divided into sixteen lines (and four stanzas, but we'll ignore them). If this poem was
    <i>syntactically
      organized</i>, we'd expect each line to correspond to a consistent grammatical unit: maybe a noun phrase like
    "the fell clutch of circumstance", maybe a subject or verb phrase, maybe a clause like "I am the master of my
    soul", maybe even a whole sentence. So let's see:</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><i>Out of the night that covers me</i> : Adverbial phrase</li>
        <li><i>Black as the pit from pole to pole</i> : Adjectival phrase</li>
        <li><i>I thank whatever gods may be</i> : Subject, verb phrase</li>

  <p class="text-main">Each of Henley's lines, then, must stand for something other than grammatical units.</p>

  <p class="text-main">It's true that in many poetic traditions, subunits of poetry <i>do</i> correspond to coherent
    syntactic units.
    In the poems of the Tembagla people of Papua New Guinea, for example, all lines are noun phrases, subordinate
    clauses, or full sentences. But what's important is that having noun phrases or sentences can't be the
    <i>defining</i>
    criteria for Tembagla poetry. After all, every word of Tembagla (like any other language) is organized into one
    sentence or another, but not every sentence that comes out of their mouths is in verse.</p>

  <p class="text-main">By contrast, in prose (like the prose I'm writing in right now), these chunks of units that
    exist on top of
    grammatical ones just aren't there.</p>

  <br />

  <h3 id="Prose" class="text-appetizer">Poetry isn't (necessarily) prosodically organized</h3>

  <p class="text-main">Sections of poetry are not determined by the prosodic (normally pronounced) divisions of the
    texst. Again, they
    may coincide, but a line of poetry is not, say, an intonation phrase.</p>

  <p class="text-main">Here's another well-known English poem:</p>

  <p style="text-align:right">
    <font face="times new roman">"An Arudel Tomb", Philip Larkin, c. 1956</font>
  </p>

  <p class="text-main">The lines and stanzas of this poem are prosodically incoherent. In the sentence that is the
    second stanza, I've
    marked the places where I'm inclined to pause when reading out loud:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <font size="4.5">
      <font face="times new roman">
        <p>Such plainness of the pre-baroque hardly involves the eye, <b>//</b> until it meets his left-hand
          gauntlet, <b>//</b> still clasped empty in the other; <b>//</b> and one sees, with a sharp tender shock,
          <b>//</b>
          his hand withdrawn, holding her hand.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </font>
  </font>

  <p>But these are Larkin's actual line breaks:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <font size="4.5">
      <font face="times new roman">
        <p>Such plainness of the pre-baroque <b>//</b> hardly involves the eye, until <b>//</b> it meets his
          left-hand gauntlet, still <b>//</b> clasped empty in the other; and <b>//</b> one sees, with a sharp tender
          shock, <b>//</b> his hand withdrawn, holding her hand.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </font>
  </font>

  <p>Larkin's lines do not correspond to any level of the phonological hierarchy, and yet its beauty is undinted.
    Again, this is not the case for all poetry in all languages. Traditional Korean poetry is exceptional in that the
    meter demands that each line contain exactly four accentual phrases, which means that the organization of poetry
    is prosodically determined. But as with the Tembaglas, not every word Koreans utter is poetry, even though every
    word they say <i>is</i> organized into accentual phrases. The fact of being organized into accentual phrases
    alone does not a poem make, Korean or otherwise.</p>

  <p>So what exactly <i>are</i> those things that define poetry?</p>

  <br>

  <h4 id="Organization" class="text-appetizer">The organization of poetry</h4>

  <p class="text-main">Nigel Fabb, whose definition of poetry we're using, argues that all poetry is defined by
    <i>lines</i>, which are
    sections of language short enough to fit into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory">"working
      memory"</a>, the short-term memory that lets us process the world around us. These lines, as mentioned, are
    independent from syntactic chunks of grammar or prosodic chunks of sound. Their existence is demonstrated by a
    number of poetic devices, principally <i>rhyme</i>, <i>meter</i>, <i>alliteration</i>, and <i>parallelism</i>.
    (Lines can also be distinguished only in the written form, as is the case in rhythmless "free verse", but these
    are usually atypical and/or extremely modern works.) We'll look at an example of each of these four, drawing on
    the two English poems above for meter and rhyme.</p>
  <br>
  <p id="Rhyme" class="subtitle">Rhyme</p>
  <p class="text-main" style="margin-top: -1em;"><a href="rhyme.html#Rhyme">See more on rhyme</a></p>
  <p class="text-main">Rhymes are probably the single device most consciously associated with poetry by English
    speakers. In the poetry
    of English and many other languages, they only occur systematically at the ends of lines and are a very obvious
    way to distinguish between lines. This is the case with "Invictus", with the ends of each line leading to a rhyme
    scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGHGH:</p>

  <p>Here's more proof of how useful rhymes can be in organizing poetry. Take a gander at the following prose
    translation of the first four lines of Poland's national epic.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>
        <font size="4.5">
          <font face="times new roman">Lithuania, my country, thou art like health; how much thou shouldst be prized
            only he can learn who has lost thee. Today thy beauty in all its splendour I see and describe, for I
            yearn for thee.
      </i></font>
      </font>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It's impossible to reconstruct how the original Polish lines were divided from this prose translation alone
    because, again, lines of poetry exist independent of syntax or meaning. Meanwhile, this is the original text:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>

  <p class="text-main">In fact, the most fundamental organizer of traditional English verse—and the most common such
    device
    worldwide—is not rhyme, but meter. In particular, English poets use a type of meter that counts units of stressed
    and unstressed syllables called "feet". Each line contains a number of feet, usually four or five for
    two-syllable feet and three or four for three-syllable feet.</p>

  <p class="text-main">Let's go back to Larkin and his earl. The lines are distinguished by an ABBCAC rhyme scheme,
    but we'll try using
    the meter to split them now. In red are the syllables I would stress in the first three stanzas:</p>

  <p class="text-main">Is the meter perfect? No. It rarely is. But a general pattern of deploying feet of "one
    unstressed syllable-one
    stressed syllable," called an <i>iamb</i> (with some minor supplementary use of a "two unstressed syllables-one
    stressed syllables" foot called an <i>anapest</i>), is clearly visible. So is the fact that every fourth iamb
    ends on a word boundary:</p>

  <p>And these four-iamb units are indeed the lines of <i>iambic tetrameter</i> that Larkin chose to write the poem
    in. An illustrative example of how meter organizes poetry.</p>

  <p id="All" class="subtitle">Alliteration</p>
  <p class="text-main" style="margin-top: -1em;"><a href="rhyme.html#Alliteration">See more on systematic alliteration</a></p>
  <p>Alliteration refers to the repetition of sounds, especially initial consonants (e.g. with "s" and "sh" in "She
    sells seashells by the seashore"). Although alliteration is used quite commonly in both English prose and poetry,
    it is never <i>systematic</i> in the sense that, say, a rhyme scheme is systematic. This is not the case in all
    languages.</p>
  <p>In the following Old Norse poem, the god Loki first announces his intention to bring strife among the gods who
    are feasting at the hall of the sea god Ægir; later, he accuses the goddess Gefjun of having slept with a boy
    simply for his necklace.</p>
  <p>The poem is in a meter called <i>ljóðaháttr</i>. In <i>ljóðaháttr</i>, each stanza has four lines. The first and
    third lines are divisible into two halves, each half having two stressed syllables. The second and fourth lines
    have three stressed syllables. The meter demands a <i>strict alliteration scheme</i> that goes like this. In the
    first and third lines, the third stressed syllable must always alliterate with one of the earlier two stressed
    syllables, and the fourth syllable may optionally alliterate with the first two syllables, but cannot alliterate
    with the third. In the second and fourth lines, at least two of the three stressed syllables must alliterate.</p>
  <p>These rules are as fundamental to <i>ljóðaháttr</i> just as much as the ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme is
    fundamental to Shakespearian sonnets. This is another, and (for English speakers) much more exotic, way to
    organize poetry.</p>
  <p>Bold are stressed syllables, red and orange the alliterating ones. For the purposes of Old Norse alliteration,
    all words that start with vowels or the consonant "j" (which is pronounced like "y" in "yellow", not as "j" in
    "judge") are considered alliterative.</p>

  <p id="Par" class="subtitle">Parallelism</p>
  <p class="text-main" style="margin-top: -1em;"><a href="rhyme.html#Parallelism">See more on systematic parallelism</a></p>
  <p class="text-main">Some poetic traditions, especially in Indonesia, Central America, the Ancient Near East, and
    among sign
    languages, organize poetry primarily through parallelisms. As with alliteration, English uses a lot of
    parallelisms too—but not <i>systematically</i>.</p>
  <p class="text-main">In the Biblical Hebrew poetic tradition, among the dominant organizers of the text is
    <i>semantic parallelism</i>.
    In semantic parallelism, a couplet (or sometimes triplet or more) of lines are placed in a pattern where the
    later line(s) usually serve(s) in the role of "focusing, specification, concretization, even what could be called
    dramatization" of the first line (Robert Alter, <i>The Art of Biblical Poetry</i>, p. 19). In other cases, the
    couplets themselves are composed of largely synonymous lines (<i>static parallelism</i>), but the overall poem
    retains the structure of intensification and concretization. Many Hebrew poems are organized almost entirely into
    such couplet structures, as in the following work, the very first poem of the Book of Psalms.</p>

  <p>We use a more recent translation that more accurately reproduces the parallelistic structures of the text:</p>

  <p>The parallelism that organizes the poem, both static and intensifying, is palpable. From stanza to stanza:</p>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li><i>Stanza 1</i> : The righteous man is introduced through three parallelisms of the structure "has not Xed in
      the Y". There are elements of both static parallelism—"the wicked's counsel", "the way of offenders", and "the
      session of scoffers" are largely synonymous—and parallelism of a progressive, intensifying sort; the wrongdoer
      against whom the happy man is defined is someone who at first "walks" with the wicked, then "stands" with them,
      and ultimately "sits" with them.</li>
    <br>
    <li><i>Stanza 2</i> : The righteous man's behavior is elaborated on through two parallel statements sharing the
      subject "teaching" (<i>bəṯôraṯ</i>). The first line is a generalization—the man desires God's teaching—and the
      second line makes it concrete—the man's desire is such that he is always "murmuring" (or "meditating upon"; the
      verb <i>yehgeh</i> is ambiguous) God's teachings. The phonological similarity between <i>YHWH</i> "the Lord"
      and <i>yehgeh</i> "murmur/meditate", both of which follow the word <i>bəṯôraṯ</i>, stresses the parallelism.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><i>Stanza 3</i> : The first line compares the righteous man to a tree. The second and third lines display a
      static parallelism (both portraying the vitality of the tree) that intensifies the meaning of the first line.
      The fourth line completes the thought by explaining what the ultimate meaning of the tree simile is. In the
      original Hebrew, the fourth line also shows a degree of phonetic parallelism with the first line: <i>wəhāyāh</i>
      "he is" and <i>yaṣlîaḥ</i> "he prospers".</li>
    <br>
    <li><i>Stanza 4</i> : The second line intensifies the first line's mention of the "wicked man" by offering visual
      imagery of what such a man would be like: "chaff that the wind drives away".</li>
    <br>
    <li><i>Stanza 5</i> : The two lines share the parallel structure "the X will not stand up in Y", but the first
      line's verb <i>yāqumū</i> "will stand up" elliptically replaces the second line's verb. The wrongdoers are
      defined through two parallel synonyms, "the wicked" and "the offenders", while the places where they cannot
      stand are intensified in the second line; the "judgment" described in the first line is elaborated as the
      judgment of "the band of the righteous."</li>
    <br>
    <li><i>Stanza 6</i> : The two lines are parallel in their opposition; they are also chiasmic, meaning that their
      parallelism is of an ABBA structure. The first line begins with the fate of a certain group ("the Lord
      embraces" them), then clarifies that this group is "the way of the righteous". The second line turns this
      around and begins by mentioning the "way of the wicked", and concludes both the parallelism and the poem with
      the fate of this group: it "is lost."</li>

        <center>What our definition of poetry entails</center>
      </font>
    </font>
  </h4>

  <p class="text-main">The definition the <i>Atlas</i> uses for poetry is quite broader than what we're normally used
    to, in many
    cases, moreso than a given culture's definition of poetry.</p>

  <p class="text-main">For example, most English song lyrics are poetry; they're organized into non-syntactic,
    non-prosodic units
    through rhyme and meter. This goes against the usual English definition of poetry, which tends to be that a poem
    is a written or recited work, not something sung.</p>

  <p class="text-main">Or take the case of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Many parts of the Quran are in rhyme.
    Yet the Quran
    explicitly says that the work does not constitute <i>shiʿr</i>, a word usually translated as "poetry", because it
    does not abide by the strict rules of meter that the Arabic language demands from a <i>shiʿr</i>. Instead, the
    Quran is defined as <i>sajʾ</i>, an Arabic word usually translated as "rhymed prose". However, by our definition,
    rhymed prose is also a form of poetry and the Quran a poetic work, albeit one with few restrictions on format.
    Our definition of poetry is broader than the range of works denoted by the Arabic <i>shiʿr</i>, just as it is
    broader than the usual English meaning of "poetry".</p>

  <p class="text-main">Completely meterless prose poetry, on the other hand, is unlikely to be treated as poetry by
    our definition.</p>

  <p class="text-main">The reason this definition is used over "poetry is what the culture defines as poetry" are
    twofold:</p>

  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Many cultures lack a specific concept of poetry. To use culture-specific definitions of poetry would mean
      that huge swathes of the globe are not covered.</li>
    <li>Even in cultures that do have a concept similar to the Western one of "poetry", there is a strong tendency to
      treat only the hyperformalized, rule-ridden literature of a tiny elite as poetry and ignore folk traditions.
      This did not seem quite fair.</li>
